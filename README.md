This repo contains two notebooks:

- [Training Notebook](./Training%20Notebook.ipynb): Note that the current notebook contains one of the final trainings done (llama) and the plot and accuracy for that model. However, the same code was used to train each of the three models. Most of the settings remained same since we needed to establish a common baseline to compare between models.

- [Comparison_between_Aligned_and_Finetuned_Model](./Comparison_between_Aligned_and_Finetuned_Model.ipynb): This notebook calculates the accuracy of each family of models between their aligned (but not finetuned) and finetuned versions.


The models that we've considered are:

1. Llama-3.1-8B
2. Phi-3.5 mini
3. Gemma 2-2B
